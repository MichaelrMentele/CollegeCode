 *Name: main
 *Returns: 0 as an integer to declare success
 *Arguments: none
 *Purpose: To compute the series and parallel resistance of a set of resistors
 *Description: The function firsts delares three double variables and two integer variables and then uses a loop to calculate them, the loop only goes until the count is the same as the number of resistors. Once the loop is done looping thefunction prints the resistance values.
 *Dependencies: none

    scanf( "%lf", &R_VALUES ); //stores value for R_VALUES

    SERIES = SERIES + R_VALUES; //Calculates series just by adding R_VALUES

    PARALLEL = PARALLEL +  1 / R_VALUES; //partially calculates Parallel resistance value however the actual value is 1 over parallel and is done in the printf below

  }

 while( COUNT < R_NUM ); //determines whether to continue loop or not

 printf("The series resistance is %.2lf",SERIES); //prints series resistance

 printf("The parallel Resistance is %.2lf",1/PARALLEL); //completes and prints parallel resistance value

 return 0; //returns 0 as an integer to signal success for the function main


}
//end of function main and program
